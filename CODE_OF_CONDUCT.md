# 🚀 HyperCode Community Code of Conduct

## 🧠 Our Neurodivergent-First Commitment

HyperCode is built by and for neurodivergent minds. We celebrate diverse cognitive styles, communication patterns, and ways of thinking. This Code of Conduct is designed to create an inclusive space where everyone can contribute their best work, regardless of how their brain processes information.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **Cognitive Diversity is Our Strength**
- We value different ways of thinking, learning, and communicating
- Neurodivergent communication patterns are not just accepted—they're celebrated
- Direct, literal, or "blunt" communication is welcome when it's respectful
- No requirement for formal language or social pleasantries

### 2. **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable**
- All contributions must consider neurodivergent accessibility
- Clear, explicit instructions and documentation are required
- Visual, auditory, and cognitive accessibility impacts must be considered
- Ask for clarification—it's encouraged, not criticized

### 3. **Respect Different Processing Speeds**
- Async participation is fully supported
- Take the time you need to formulate responses
- No pressure for immediate replies or quick decisions
- Processing time is a feature, not a bug

### 4. **Constructive Communication**
- Focus on technical solutions, not social conventions
- Be direct about technical issues and concerns
- Assume technical competence and good intentions
- Separate ideas from people—critique code, not coders

## ✅ Welcome Behaviors

### Communication
- **Direct technical feedback**: "This approach has security implications because..."
- **Literal interpretation**: Take statements at face value
- **Questioning assumptions**: "Why did we choose this architecture?"
- **Requesting clarification**: "I don't understand this part, can you explain?"
- **Special interest deep dives**: Share your expertise enthusiastically
- **Pattern recognition**: Point out connections others might miss

### Technical Contributions
- **Code that prioritizes clarity**: Even if it's more verbose
- **Documentation that explains the "why"**: Not just the "how"
- **Accessibility-first design**: Consider sensory processing differences
- **Consistent patterns**: Help reduce cognitive load
- **Error handling that's informative**: Help with debugging and learning

### Community Support
- **Answering questions literally**: No need for social softening
- **Sharing resources directly**: Links, docs, examples
- **Acknowledging effort**: "Good work on this feature" is sufficient
- **Mentoring with explicit steps**: Clear, actionable guidance

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behaviors

### Never Acceptable
- **Deliberate exclusion**: Ignoring questions or contributions
- **Mocking communication style**: Making fun of how someone speaks or writes
- **Weaponizing neurodiversity**: Using neurodivergence as an excuse for harmful behavior
- **Accessibility disregard**: "It's not that hard to understand" or similar dismissals
- **Unsolicited social coaching**: Telling someone how they "should" communicate

### Technical Harassment
- **Sabotaging contributions**: Deliberately breaking or undermining work
- **Gatekeeping knowledge**: Withholding information to maintain advantage
- **Dismissive code reviews**: "This is obvious" or "You should know this"
- **Credit stealing**: Taking credit for others' work or ideas

### Personal Attacks
- **Targeting neurodivergent traits**: Mocking stims, special interests, or processing differences
- **Microaggressions**: Subtle digs at cognitive styles or communication patterns
- **Outing**: Disclosing someone's neurodivergent status without permission
- **Pressure to "mask"**: Demanding neurotypical communication patterns

## 🛡️ Enforcement Guidelines

### Reporting Process
1. **Direct Contact**: If you feel safe, address the issue directly with the person
2. **Private Report**: Email conduct@hypercode.dev or open a private issue
3. **Moderator Review**: Our team will review within 48 hours
4. **Action Plan**: Clear steps and timeline for resolution

### Consequences
- **First offense**: Private warning and education opportunity
- **Second offense**: Temporary suspension (1-4 weeks)
- **Third offense**: Permanent ban from the community
- **Severe violations**: Immediate permanent ban

### Appeal Process
- Appeals go to a different moderator than the original decision
- Appeals must be submitted within 7 days of action
- Decision on appeals is final

## 🎉 Why This Matters

HyperCode isn't just a programming language—it's a movement to make technology development truly inclusive. By embracing neurodivergent ways of thinking and communicating, we're not just being nice—we're building better technology.

Different minds see different solutions. Different perspectives create stronger systems. Different communication styles prevent groupthink.

**Your brain is welcome here. Exactly as it is.** 🧠✨
