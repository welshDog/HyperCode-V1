# 🎯 HyperCode Development Roadmap

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Core Language (Solidify)

### Lexer
- [x] Complete lexer edge cases (basic tokenization and operators implemented)
- [x] Unicode handling (for neurodivergent-friendly symbols)
- [x] Comment syntax finalization (handled in lexer.py)
- [x] String escape sequences (basic string handling implemented)

### Parser
- [x] Finalize parser (basic parsing implemented)
- [x] Error recovery (basic error handling in place)
- [ ] AST node completeness
- [ ] Operator precedence rules documented

### Interpreter
- [ ] Interpreter robustness
- [ ] Variable scoping (global/local/closure)
- [ ] Function definitions & calls
- [ ] Built-in functions library (print, len, type, etc.)

## 🚀 Phase 2: Developer Experience

### Error Handling
- [x] Error messages (basic implementation in place)
- [ ] Rewrite all errors to be ADHD/dyslexia-friendly
- [ ] Add "Did you mean...?" suggestions
- [x] Include line/column with context (implemented in LexerError)
- [ ] Color-coded output for terminals

### Documentation
- [ ] Language specification (complete, clear, with examples)
- [ ] Tutorial for beginners
- [ ] API docs for built-in functions
- [x] Accessibility guide (started in CONTRIBUTING.md, mentions neurodivergence support)

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for lexer, parser, interpreter (lexer tests exist)
- [ ] Integration tests (full program runs)
- [ ] Edge case tests (empty files, huge inputs, etc.)
- [x] CI/CD with GitHub Actions (GitHub workflow file exists)

## 🌱 Phase 3: Ecosystem & Contrib Readiness

### Contributor Setup
- [x] Create CONTRIBUTING.md (exists with detailed instructions)
- [x] Add Code of Conduct (exists as CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [ ] Label "Good First Issue" labels on GitHub

### Repository Hygiene
- [x] Add .gitignore (exists)
- [x] Add SECURITY.md (exists)
- [x] Add CHANGELOG.md (exists)
- [ ] Run pip audit – check for dependency vulnsecurity)

### Nice-to-Have Extras
- [ ] Web playground (browser-based runner)
- [ ] VS Code syntax highlighter extension
- [ ] Package manager setup

## ⚡ Quick Wins (Low Hanging Fruit)
- [ ] Finalize error messages (5-10 mins per type)
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions test runner (workflow file exists)
- [x] Draft CONTRIBUTING.md (exists and is comprehensive)
- [ ] Run type checking: `mypy src/`
- [ ] Add inline code comments to core files (1-2 hours)

## 📊 Priority Ranking

### MUST DO (Blocking)
- Core interpreter stability
- Friendly error messages
- Basic test coverage

### SHOULD DO (Launch Ready)
- Documentation
- Contributing guide
- GitHub Actions CI/CD

### NICE TO HAVE (Polish)
- Web playground
- IDE extensions
- Advanced optimization
