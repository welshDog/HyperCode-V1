# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What exactly is HyperCode?

HyperCode is a **programming language designed for all minds**, with a special focus on
neurodivergent developers (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, etc.). It combines forgotten esoteric
language concepts with modern AI integration and neurodivergent-first design principles.

Think of it as: **Brainfuck meets modern JavaScript, designed by people with ADHD.**

### Why do we need another programming language?

Excellent question! Most programming languages were designed by neurotypical people, for
neurotypical brains. They often feature:

- Dense, noisy syntax that overwhelms dyslexic readers
- Rigid structures that don't match ADHD thought patterns
- Assumptions about "normal" learning styles
- Zero accessibility considerations

HyperCode flips this: **It's designed by and for neurodivergent minds first**, then made
universally accessible.

### Is HyperCode production-ready?

**No, not yet.** We're in Phase 1 (Foundation), targeting v0.1 release in early 2026 and
v1.0 stable release in mid-2026. That said, we welcome early adopters, feedback, and
contributions!

### Can I use HyperCode for real projects?

Currently, HyperCode is **experimental**. Use it for:

- Learning and exploration
- Contributing to the project
- Fun and creative experiments
- Educational purposes

**Not recommended (yet) for:**

- Production systems
- Mission-critical applications
- Commercial products (until v1.0)

### How is HyperCode different from Python, JavaScript, or Rust?

| Aspect                             | HyperCode   | Python | JavaScript | Rust   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| **Neurodivergent-First**           | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |
| **AI-Native**                      | ✅ Built-in | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |
| **Accessible Design**              | ✅ Priority | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |
| **Inspired by Esoteric Languages** | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |
| **Dyslexia-Friendly**              | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |
| **Production-Ready**               | 🔄 Soon     | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes |

## Neurodiversity & Accessibility

### I'm neurodivergent. Will HyperCode actually work for my brain?

**We're building it with you in mind.** That said:

- If something _doesn't_ work for you, **tell us**. We'll fix it.
- Early feedback from neurodivergent developers is crucial.
- Different neurodivergent brains work differently—there's no one-size-fits-all
  solution.

HyperCode aims to be more accessible than mainstream languages, but it's not magic. If
you have specific needs or suggestions, open an issue or discussion!

### What if I'm neurotypical? Can I still use HyperCode?

**Absolutely!** HyperCode is designed _for_ neurodivergent minds but _welcoming to
everyone_. Neurotypical developers often find the clean, visual syntax refreshing and
productive too.

### Will HyperCode help with my ADHD/autism/dyslexia?

HyperCode is designed with these conditions in mind, featuring:

- **For ADHD**: Clear structure, visual flow, less cognitive load
- **For Dyslexia**: Clean fonts, high contrast, minimal visual noise
- **For Autism**: Logical patterns, explicit rules, minimal ambiguity

But we can't promise it will "fix" your condition. What we _can_ promise: **We're
building something that doesn't work _against_ your brain.**

### How accessible is the documentation?

We're prioritizing accessibility from day one:

- ✅ Screen reader tested
- ✅ Dyslexia-friendly fonts
- ✅ Captions on video tutorials (coming soon)
- ✅ Alt text on all diagrams
- ✅ Multiple explanation formats
- ✅ Accessible color contrast

**Issues with accessibility? Report them
[here](https://github.com/HyperCode-Labs/HyperCode/issues).**

## Technical Questions

### What's the tech stack?

- **Language**: TypeScript (compiles to JavaScript)
- **Runtime**: Node.js 16+
- **Parser**: Custom lexer and AST-based parser
- **AI Integration**: REST/WebSocket APIs
- **Testing**: Jest
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Build**: npm

### Can HyperCode run in the browser?

**Eventually, yes!** Currently it runs on Node.js. We're planning browser support in
Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2026).

### How do I install HyperCode?

Once released (v0.1+):

```bash
npm install hypercode
```

For now, clone the repo and follow [Getting Started guide](../docs/getting-started.md).

### Can I compile HyperCode to JavaScript/Python/Rust?

**Yes, that's the plan!** HyperCode can transpile to multiple languages, making it a
bridge between the future and existing ecosystems.

---

## AI Integration

### What AI platforms does HyperCode support?

**Phase 2 integrations (coming Q1-Q2 2026):**

- GPT-4/4o
- Claude 3+
- Mistral
- Ollama (local models)
- Custom LLM frameworks

Currently, HyperCode is designed to be AI-compatible but integrations aren't live yet.

### Can HyperCode generate code with AI?

**Yes, that's part of the vision!** Features like `THINK-WITH ChatGPT` will let you
collaborate with AI directly in your code. But this is Phase 2.

### Is my code sent to external AI services?

**No.** HyperCode respects your privacy. You control:

- Which AI platform you use (or run your own local model)
- Whether code is sent anywhere
- How your data is handled
