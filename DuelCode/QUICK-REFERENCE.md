# 🚀 HyperCode Dual Coding Quick Reference
## One-Page Cheat Sheet for Doc Writers

**Print this. Post it. USE IT.** 👊

---

## The Core Formula

```
TRADITIONAL DOC (❌ Hard for neurodivergent learners):
Text explanation → Code example → Maybe a diagram

HYPERCODE DOC (✅ Dual Coded):
Visual SIMULTANEOUSLY with Text
+ Code example IMMEDIATELY shown
+ Interactive demo RIGHT THERE
+ Challenge to reinforce
```

---

## Visual + Text Pairing Template

```markdown
## 🎯 Concept Name

### 📊 Visual (ASCII, Diagram, Table)

[VISUAL REPRESENTATION HERE]

### 📝 Explanation (2-3 sentences max)

[CLEAR TEXT HERE]

### 💻 Code Example

[CODE BLOCK]

### ▶️ Run It

[Command to execute]

### 🎉 Output

[Expected result]
```

## Quick Checklist for Every Page

- [ ] **Visual first**: Diagram/chart visible BEFORE reading
- [ ] **Text alongside**: Not after, ALONGSIDE the visual
- [ ] **Code immediately**: Example shown right after concept
- [ ] **Run + Output**: Show what happens when code executes
- [ ] **Chunked**: No paragraph > 80 words
- [ ] **Spaced**: Lots of whitespace
- [ ] **Font**: Sans-serif, 16pt+, NOT justified
- [ ] **Color**: High contrast, color-not-only meaning
- [ ] **Challenge**: At least one challenge included
- [ ] **Mistakes**: Common errors called out
- [ ] **Next Steps**: Clear path forward

## Visual Options (Pick One Per Concept)

| Visual Type | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **ASCII Diagram** | Show process/structure | Memory cells, data flow |
| **Table** | Compare options | Operations vs. effects |
| **Flowchart** | Show decision logic | If/then branches |
| **Timeline** | Show sequence | Step-by-step execution |
| **Matrix** | Show relationships | Features vs. neurotypes |

## Font & Spacing Rules

### Typography

```
Heading:     32pt, bold, Arial
Subheading:  24pt, bold, Arial
Body:        16pt, regular, Arial
Code:        14pt, monospace, Courier
```

### Line Height & Spacing

```
Body text:      1.5x line height
Code blocks:    1.2x line height
Paragraphs:     1rem (16px) spacing
Sections:       2-3rem (32-48px) spacing
```

### DO & DON'T

```
✅ DO:
- Sans-serif fonts
- Bold for emphasis
- Letter-spacing: +0.12em (optional toggle)
- Ample white space
- Color + texture (not color alone)

❌ DON'T:
- Italic text in large blocks
- Justified paragraphs
- All-caps (except acronyms)
- Dense paragraphs (> 5 lines)
- Colored text without background
- Flashing or auto-playing content
```

---

## Dual Coding Examples

### ❌ BAD (Text-Only)

```
A variable stores a value in memory. When you create 
a variable, the computer allocates memory space. 
The name refers to this location. Later, you can 
access the value by using the name.
```

### ✅ GOOD (Dual Coded)

```
VISUAL (ASCII):
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Variable: name      │
│ Memory Loc: 0x1234  │
│ Value: "Alice"      │
└─────────────────────┘

TEXT (Simple):
A **variable** = named box in memory
- Box location: memory address
- Box contents: the value
- Box name: what you call it
```

## Common Mistakes Section Template

### ❌ Mistake Pattern

```markdown
## ❌ Mistake: [Description]

### Wrong Code:
[CODE BLOCK - bad version]

### Why It Fails:
[Short explanation of the problem]

### ✅ Correct:
[CODE BLOCK - good version]

### Key Idea:
[One sentence reinforcing the lesson]
```

## Accessibility Metadata Template

```markdown
## ♿ Accessibility Features

**This page uses:**
- ✅ Dual Coding (visual + text)
- ✅ High contrast (WCAG AA)
- ✅ Dyslexia-friendly fonts
- ✅ No flashing content
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Keyboard accessible
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Customizable fonts
- ✅ No time limits
- ✅ Multiple formats

**Tested with**: Screen readers, keyboard nav, 
dyslexic readers, ADHD brains, autistic learners
```

---

## Section Order (Always)

1. **Objective** (What you'll learn)
2. **Checklist** (Prerequisites)
3. **Concept** (Visual + Text)
4. **Hands-On** (Code + Output)
5. **Visualization** (Deep diagram)
6. **Challenges** (Easy → Hard)
7. **Mistakes** (Common errors)
8. **Takeaways** (Summary table)
9. **Next Steps** (What's next)
10. **Support** (How to get help)

## Color Coding by Topic

```
Math/Logic:     🔵 Blue
Loops/Flow:     🟠 Orange
Variables/Data: 🟢 Green
I/O:            🔴 Red
Comments:       ⚪ Grey
Errors:         🔴 Red (bold)
Success:        🟢 Green (bold)
```

---

## Word Count Guidelines

```
Heading:           < 8 words
Concept intro:     < 25 words (one sentence)
Explanation para:  < 80 words (3-4 sentences)
Chunk size:        200-300 words max
Full page:         1500-2000 words max

Neurodivergent brains process LESS text faster.
Short > Long.
Visual > Text-only.
Chunked > Dense.
```

## Before Publishing Checklist

- [ ] Does visual come BEFORE text?
- [ ] Is visual AND text on SAME screen?
- [ ] Can a dyslexic person understand quickly?
- [ ] Can an ADHD person skip to what they need?
- [ ] Can an autistic person find the rules?
- [ ] Are all steps explicit (no assumed knowledge)?
- [ ] Is there a visible progress indicator?
- [ ] Can they run code immediately?
- [ ] Do they see output right away?
- [ ] Is the font readable (16pt+)?
- [ ] Is there ample whitespace?
- [ ] Are common mistakes addressed?
- [ ] Is there a clear next step?

## The Golden Rule

**If your page works for ADHD + Dyslexic + Autistic learners, it WILL work for everyone.**

Accessibility isn't a side feature. It's the MAIN feature.

---

## Example: Perfect Page Structure

```
[EMOJI] HEADING (8 words max)

[VISUAL - Diagram/Table/ASCII]

[TEXT - 2-3 sentences max]

[CODE BLOCK - ready to copy]

[COMMAND to run it]

[EXPECTED OUTPUT]

[CHALLENGE with hints]

[COMMON MISTAKE section]

[TABLE with key ideas]

[NEXT STEPS]
